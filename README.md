# Basic-Language-Interpreter

### Basic Language Syntax
```
  LET X = 32;
  PRINT(X)
```
In this project, i wll be making a BASIC programming language interpreter. Using C++.

Why I chose C++?

I've thought about using python to build this project but then python is also an interpreted language, right?  So that could mean that running an interepreted language on top
of an interpreted language can be slow in runtime. So i opted for C++

Update:
The interpreter currently has the following features:
  - Print Statements
  - Variable assignments (only for numbers)
  - Arithmetic Operations
  - If-Else statements
  - While/For loops Statements


This Interpreter is still work in progress
