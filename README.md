# Psuedocode Interpreter

### Syntax
```
  X = 32;
  PRINT(X)

  FOR y = 1 TO 10
    PRINT y
    PRINT "\n"
  END

y = INPUT "Enter a number: "
PRINT y

```

__Output__

10
Enter a number: 3

In this project, i wll be making a Psuedocode like syntax interpreter using C++.

Why C++?

I've thought about using python to build this project but then python is also an interpreted language, right?  So that could mean that running an interepreted language on top
of an interpreted language can be slow in runtime. So i opted for C++

Update:
The interpreter currently has the following features:
  - Print Statements
  - Variable assignments (Strings and Double)
  - Arithmetic Operations
  - If-Else statements
  - While/For loops Statements
  - Inputs (Strings and Double)
  - Array Indexing
