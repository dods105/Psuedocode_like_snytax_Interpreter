# Basic-Language-Interpreter


In this project, i wll be making a BASIC programming language interpreter. Using C++.

### Basic Language Syntax
```
  LET X = 32;
  PRINT(X)
```

This will be a 25 day project of mine. Where in I will be also uploading 1 to 2 lessons for each day for each topic that i have learned. 
So there will be a total of 30 lesson. The full source code will be uploaded once the project has been finished.


Why I chose C++?

I've thought about using python to build this project

but then python is also an interpreted language, right? 
So that could mean that running an interepreted language on top
of an interpreted language can be slow in runtime. So i opted for C++

### How i will be making this

There are a total of 30 markdown files onto which I will explain what each function/methods and classes are for.

__Lesson 1 - What is a Lexer__
